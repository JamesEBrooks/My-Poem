The Rain and Sunny
It falls .. on my head
It's wet
I am wet
I can see two buses, life is so ironic
It's green like a bottle of gin or tionic
No, no it's not..
It's out of service
But it's not so bad as..
I can see the sun
It's warm in 1984
..too warm
the buses have long gone, it's the lull before the strom
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Lightning
Lightning... crash..

Crash

Crash
